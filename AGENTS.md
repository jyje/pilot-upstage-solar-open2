# pilot-upstage-solar-open2

A repo hosting several independent agent-harness use cases built around
Upstage's Solar Open2 model and the Claude Code / OpenAI Codex /
LangChain / Hermes Agent ecosystem. See [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the full plan and [`README.md`](README.md)
for the public-facing overview.

```

Referred to as **Case 01 / Case 02 / ...** in prose and docs — the
numbered directory prefixes are just filesystem sort order, not a rename
target. All cases live at the top level as one flat list, with no split
between "core" and "special" cases.

Each case directory is a self-contained experiment with its own `src/`
(uv-managed, or a Node project for Case 04), or a Docker-based runnable
configuration for Case 05. All are implemented and verified.

Each has its own `scripts/verify.sh`. All 5 run, solar-open2 only, as
steps in the single `.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml`
workflow (manual `workflow_dispatch`), which reuses the same
`UPSTAGE_API_KEY` secret. Case 03 pins Python 3.13 instead of 3.14 (the
default elsewhere) — see its README for why.

## Skills available

- `centered-readme` — format README headers as a centered hero block
- `git-commit-helper` — gitmoji + conventional-commit-ish commit message policy
- `python-lint` — ruff + ty + pytest workflow, required for any Python change

## Conventions

- **Language**: all source code and code comments are English only — no
  Korean in code, docstrings, or inline comments.
- **README language**: English is the default for every README's primary
  content. Every scenario — the repo root and every case directory —
  gets a Korean twin (`README-ko.md`) with the same language navigator
  style. Everything else (source code, comments, `AGENTS.md`, `PLAN.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`) stays English-only.
- **Python changes**: run the `python-lint` skill's workflow (ruff check,
  ruff format, ty check, pytest) before considering a Python change done.
- **Commits**: follow the `git-commit-helper` skill's gitmoji + type/domain
  format. Never commit or push without explicit user approval.
