# pilot-upstage-solar-open2

Portfolio/seminar repo hosting three independent agent-harness experiments
built around Upstage's Solar Open2 model and the Claude Code / OpenAI Codex /
LangChain agent ecosystem. See [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the full plan and [`README.md`](README.md)
for the public-facing overview.

Referred to as **Case 01 / Case 02 / ...** in prose and docs — the
numbered directory prefixes are just filesystem sort order, not a rename
target. Cases 01-03 are the three core **Experiments**; Case 04 onward
are **Special Use Cases** — more specific integrations, expected to grow
over time, kept in their own root README section separate from the core
three. Each case directory is a self-contained experiment with its own
`src/` (uv-managed, or a Node project for Case 04). All are implemented
and verified, each with its own `scripts/verify.sh` and a matching
`.github/workflows/verify-<case>.yml` that reuses the same
`UPSTAGE_API_KEY` secret. Case 03 pins Python 3.13 instead of 3.14 (the
default elsewhere) — see its README for why.

## Skills available

- `centered-readme` — format README headers as a centered hero block
- `git-commit-helper` — gitmoji + conventional-commit-ish commit message policy
- `python-lint` — ruff + ty + pytest workflow, required for any Python change

## Conventions

- **Language**: all source code and code comments are English only — no
  Korean in code, docstrings, or inline comments.
- **README language**: English is the default for every README's primary
  content. Every scenario — the repo root and each topic (01, 02, 03) —
  gets a Korean twin (`README-ko.md`) with the same language navigator
  style. Everything else (source code, comments, `AGENTS.md`, `PLAN.md`)
  stays English-only.
- **Python changes**: run the `python-lint` skill's workflow (ruff check,
  ruff format, ty check, pytest) before considering a Python change done.
- **Commits**: follow the `git-commit-helper` skill's gitmoji + type/domain
  format. Never commit or push without explicit user approval.
