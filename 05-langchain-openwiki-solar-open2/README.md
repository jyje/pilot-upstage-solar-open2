# Case 05 — Solar Open 2 x LangChain OpenWiki, documenting pilot-upstage-solar-open2

See [`REPRODUCE.md`](REPRODUCE.md) for step-by-step local setup.

**Status:** Verified — [`openwiki`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/openwiki)
answers real questions about this very repo, powered by Upstage's Solar
Open 2 model, via a patched build that fixes a real streaming bug
uncovered along the way.

## Goal

Use `openwiki` — a CLI that builds and maintains an agent-readable wiki
for a codebase — configured to run on **Solar Open 2** instead of its
typical Anthropic/OpenAI defaults. Target **this repo itself**
(`pilot-upstage-solar-open2`): document its latest commit, and answer
questions about it.

## How it works

`openwiki` operates on its current working directory — no target-path
flag needed, just `cd` into a checkout and run it.

To keep this repo's real root untouched (no injected `AGENTS.md` blocks,
no `openwiki/` folder, no auto-PR bot),
[`scripts/verify.sh`](scripts/verify.sh) shallow-clones
`pilot-upstage-solar-open2` into a gitignored `scratch/` directory and
runs `openwiki` there instead of against the live checkout.

## Finding 1: the `anthropic` provider can't reach Solar Open 2

`openwiki` supports an `anthropic` provider, but its source
(`src/agent/index.ts`) constructs `ChatAnthropic` with only `apiKey` (→
`x-api-key` header). It never sends `authToken` (→ `Authorization:
Bearer`), unlike the Python tools in Case 01 and Case 03.

We confirmed this directly: called Upstage's Anthropic-compatible
endpoint with the raw `@anthropic-ai/sdk` JS client using `apiKey`, and
got an immediate **401 `invalid_api_key`**. Not a hang — Upstage's
Anthropic-compatible endpoint plainly rejects `x-api-key` auth. A real,
confirmed dead end as currently written.

**Workaround used:** the generic `openai-compatible` provider, which is
Bearer-authenticated and matches Upstage's OpenAI-compatible endpoint
exactly (the same one `ChatUpstage` used in Case 04):

```bash
OPENWIKI_PROVIDER=openai-compatible
OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY=$UPSTAGE_API_KEY
OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL=https://api.upstage.ai/v1/solar
OPENWIKI_MODEL_ID=solar-open2
```

## Finding 2: Solar Open 2 drops the tool_call function name when streaming

Switching to `openai-compatible` wasn't enough on its own. Every
tool-using run failed with `400 Invalid function name: ''`. We traced the
actual wire traffic with a small local logging proxy in front of
Upstage's API:

- The **request** always sent all 16 of `openwiki`'s tools correctly
  named (`ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `task`, ...). Not a malformed
  request.
- The **response** (streamed) came back with a tool call whose arguments
  matched the `ls` tool (`{"path":"/"}`), but whose `function.name` was
  **empty**. `openwiki` correctly rejected the unknown `""` tool and fed
  that error back. Upstage then rejected it on the *next* turn, since an
  empty-named `tool_call` in the conversation history fails its own
  schema validation.
- We isolated it further with a raw, minimal request: the exact same
  request with `stream: false` comes back with the correct name
  (`"ls"`). **Only the streamed response drops the name.**

This is a genuine Upstage/Solar Open 2 streaming bug, or possibly a
client/server chunking mismatch — either way, it's not something in
`openwiki`'s or `deepagents`'s own code. But `openwiki` had no way to opt
out of streaming for this provider path.

So we added a **small patch to a fork**
(`jyje/openwiki`, branch `fix/disable-streaming-for-tool-calling-providers`):
a new `OPENWIKI_DISABLE_STREAMING=true` env var that sets
`streaming: false` on the underlying `ChatOpenAI` for the generic
provider branch. It's an opt-in escape hatch, so every other
`openai-compatible`-family provider keeps streaming as before. Verified:
with this flag set, the exact same failing request now succeeds and
returns the correct tool name.

## Finding 3: full documentation generation exceeds the default rate limit

`openwiki code --update` (the command that actually writes `openwiki/`
docs) sends a large (~57KB) system prompt on every turn, and needs
several tool-calling round trips to explore a multi-case repo like this
one. That's enough on its own to exceed Upstage's default
**50,000-tokens/minute** rate limit within a single run, independent of
any other traffic.

This is a capacity/tier constraint, not a code bug. `scripts/verify.sh`
still attempts it (best-effort) but doesn't gate on it. The 3-question
Q&A below — cheap, single-turn calls — is the hard, reliably-passing
check.

## The 3 questions

Real answers from an `openwiki code -p "<question>"` run — not
hand-picked or edited:

1. **"What is this repository (pilot-upstage-solar-open2) about?"**
2. **"What did the most recent commit change?"**
3. **"How many experiment cases does this repo have, and what does each one demonstrate?"**

## Verified methods

Real output from one CI run of `verify.sh` — not hand-picked or edited.
The script's own preview now shows up to ~700 characters (10+ wrapped
lines) per answer instead of a single 100-char fragment, specifically so
you can judge how the model reasoned through each question, not just
that it answered. Click through to read the run yourself:

Q2's answer landed under the new ~700-char cap, so that one isn't even
truncated — a real example of Solar Open 2 giving a complete, cited
answer (commit hash, message, intent, and co-authors) about this very
repo's own git history.

## Verification

[`scripts/verify.sh`](scripts/verify.sh) shallow-clones this repo,
answers the 3 questions above via `openwiki code -p` (hard gate), and
attempts full documentation generation via `openwiki code --update`
(best-effort, per Finding 3).

It requires the patched `openwiki` build from
[`jyje/openwiki`](https://github.com/jyje/openwiki/tree/fix/disable-streaming-for-tool-calling-providers) —
the public npm release doesn't have the streaming fix yet.

Run locally with `UPSTAGE_API_KEY` set and the patched `openwiki` on
PATH:

```bash
UPSTAGE_API_KEY="..." ./scripts/verify.sh
```

Runs as a step in CI (manual dispatch, solar-open2 only):
[`.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml`](../.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml) —
builds the patched fork from source (`pnpm install && pnpm run build &&
npm link`), reusing the same `UPSTAGE_API_KEY` repository secret as
every other case.

## Solar Pro4

No bridge needed: `openwiki`'s generic `openai-compatible` provider
reaches Upstage's Chat Completions endpoint directly, same as
`solar-open2`.

Locally verified 2026-08-03 (full log:
[`logs/local-verification/2026-08-03/case-05-solar-pro4.log`](../logs/local-verification/2026-08-03/case-05-solar-pro4.log)):
all 3 questions in the hard-gate Q&A passed against `solar-pro4`, after
waiting for a full rate-limit reset between each — the same pattern
this repo already documents for Solar Open 2 (Finding 3). Best-effort
`openwiki code --update` still hit a rate limit as expected; non-gating.
