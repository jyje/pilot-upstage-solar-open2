# Runs `openwiki` (github.com/langchain-ai/openwiki) against a scratch
# shallow clone of this very repo (pilot-upstage-solar-open2), configured to use
# Upstage's Solar Open 2 model via the `openai-compatible` provider —
# not `anthropic`, which openwiki's own code can't point at Upstage (see
# README.md's first Finding). Never touches this repo's real
# AGENTS.md — everything happens inside scratch/, gitignored.
#
# Requires a patched `openwiki` build — see README.md's second Finding:
# Solar Open 2 drops the tool_call function name when streaming, so
# OPENWIKI_DISABLE_STREAMING=true is required (a fix added to
# jyje/openwiki, not yet upstream). `git`, `openwiki` on PATH,
# UPSTAGE_API_KEY set.
#
# The 3-question Q&A is the hard pass/fail gate — cheap, reliable calls.
# Full documentation generation (`code --update`) is attempted as a
# best-effort step and does NOT fail the script: it's a much heavier,
# multi-turn call that has hit Upstage's default 50k-tokens/minute rate
# limit in practice (see README.md's third Finding) — a capacity/tier
# constraint, not a code bug.

# single upfront check isn't enough: one question alone (openwiki's
# multi-round-trip tool-calling loop) can burn most of the per-minute
# token budget by itself (confirmed live in run 29869480343: question 1
# alone used 36,440 of a 49,998-token budget), so headroom that looked
# fine before question 1 can be gone by question 3. A lighter "wait only
# if headroom looks thin" threshold check wasn't enough either: retries
# kept reporting 0 tokens remaining even after waiting past the reported
# reset instant, since Upstage's limit is a rolling per-minute window,
# not a hard reset clock — so this waits for a *full* reset instead
# (wait-for-upstage-full-reset.sh, 10-minute cap per wait).
