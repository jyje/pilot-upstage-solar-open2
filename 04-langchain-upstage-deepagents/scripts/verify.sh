# langchain-upstage + deepagents, and fails loudly if any of its three
# methods don't check out:
#   A. tool use            - a plain custom tool, invoked and answered
#   B. virtual filesystem  - deepagents' built-in mock file tools
#   C. subagent delegation - a named subagent handles part of the task
