**Status:** Verified — a `deepagents` agent initialized at the code level
with `langchain-upstage` as the model backend, against Upstage's Solar
Open 2 model. All three methods confirmed working end to end (locally and
in CI).

## Goal

Initialize a [`deepagents`](https://pypi.org/project/deepagents/) agent
purely at the code level, using
[`langchain-upstage`](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-upstage/) to
supply Solar Open 2 as the model. Unlike Case 01 and Case 03, there's no Claude Code
CLI involved anywhere in this path — this is LangChain/LangGraph talking
to Upstage directly.

## How it works

`ChatUpstage` (from `langchain-upstage`) is a thin `BaseChatOpenAI`
subclass pointed at Upstage's **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint
(`https://api.upstage.ai/v1/solar` by default) and reads `UPSTAGE_API_KEY`
from the environment automatically:

```python
from langchain_upstage import ChatUpstage
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

model = ChatUpstage(model="solar-open2")
agent = create_deep_agent(model=model, tools=[...], system_prompt="...")
agent.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}]})
```

That's the whole auth story — no `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`/`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
dance, no `claude` CLI subprocess. Case 01 and Case 03 had to route through
Anthropic's Messages API wire format (Upstage exposes that compatibility
layer too, at a different host path). This case skips it entirely,
using Upstage's native OpenAI-compatible endpoint through the LangChain
integration Upstage itself publishes.

## Finding: Python 3.14 doesn't work here (yet)

Case 04 pins **3.13**. Case 03 (the repo's other `uv`-managed Python
case) was moved down to 3.13 too, so both Python cases stay on one
version instead of leaving Case 03 ahead on 3.14.

The cause, confirmed by actually trying it: `langchain-upstage` depends
on `tokenizers` (a Rust/PyO3 extension), and no `tokenizers` release —
checked `0.20.3` through the current `0.23.1` — ships a `cp314` wheel
yet. Building it from source also failed in this environment: a real
`cargo`/PyO3 compile error, not a missing-toolchain issue.

This is an upstream ecosystem gap, not something a config change can work
around. Case 04 will move back to 3.14 once `tokenizers` (or an
alternative Upstage integration that doesn't pull it in) supports it.

## Three methods

### Method A — tool use

```python
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather for a city."""
    return f"It is sunny in {city}."

agent = create_deep_agent(model=model, tools=[get_weather], ...)
agent.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in Seoul?"}]})
```

A plain custom tool the agent must call correctly to answer.

### Method B — deepagents' built-in virtual filesystem

```python
agent = create_deep_agent(model=model, system_prompt="...file tools...")
result = agent.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content":
    "Write the text HELLO-DEEPAGENTS to a file named note.txt using your file tools."}]})
result["files"]["/note.txt"]["content"]  # -> "HELLO-DEEPAGENTS"
```

`deepagents` ships a mock/virtual filesystem out of the box — no real
disk I/O, the file lives in the agent's state. Deterministic to check.

### Method C — subagent delegation

```python
subagents = [{
    "name": "math-agent",
    "description": "Use this subagent for any arithmetic/math task.",
    "system_prompt": "You are a math specialist. Use the add_numbers tool.",
    "tools": [add_numbers],
}]
agent = create_deep_agent(model=model, subagents=subagents, ...)
agent.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content":
    "Use the math-agent subagent to compute 17 + 25, then tell me the result."}]})
```

The main agent delegates arithmetic to a named subagent instead of doing
it itself — both the main agent and the subagent run on Solar Open 2.

## Verified methods

Real output from one CI run of `verify.sh` — `demo.py`'s own preview now
shows up to ~700 chars (10+ wrapped lines) instead of a single <=100-char
line, same as every other case. Not hand-picked or edited. Click through

(or browse [every run](https://github.com/jyje/pilot-upstage-solar-open2/actions/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml) for the latest)

| Method | Result |
| --- | --- |
| A — tool use | `It's sunny in Seoul!` |
| B — virtual filesystem | `HELLO-DEEPAGENTS` (`result["files"]["/note.txt"]["content"]`) |
| C — subagent delegation | `17 + 25 = **42**` (from the `math-agent` subagent) |

## Verification

[`scripts/verify.sh`](scripts/verify.sh) runs `src/demo.py`, which
executes all three methods for real against Solar Open 2. It exits
non-zero if any of them don't check out: Method A's answer missing
"sunny"/"Seoul", Method B's file content wrong, or Method C's reply
missing "42".

Python changes here go through the `python-lint` skill's workflow —
`ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `ty check`, `pytest` — before
`verify.sh` runs, both locally and in CI.

Run locally with `UPSTAGE_API_KEY` set:

```bash
UPSTAGE_API_KEY="..." ./scripts/verify.sh
```

Runs as a step in CI (manual dispatch, solar-open2 only):
[`.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml`](../.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml) —
no Node/`claude`-CLI install step needed, unlike Case 01 and Case 03 — reusing the
same `UPSTAGE_API_KEY` repository secret.

## Solar Pro4

No bridge needed: `ChatUpstage` reaches Upstage's OpenAI-compatible
endpoint directly, the same path `solar-open2` already uses — no
Anthropic-shaped protocol involved.

Locally verified 2026-08-03 (full log:
[`logs/local-verification/2026-08-03/case-04-solar-pro4.log`](../logs/local-verification/2026-08-03/case-04-solar-pro4.log)):
Methods A (tool use) and B (virtual filesystem) passed cleanly on every
attempt. Method C (named subagent delegation) hit persistent rate
limiting after a day of heavy cumulative testing across every case plus
the proxy setup — consistent with this repo's documented Tier-0 capacity
pattern (see PLAN.md's Case 05, Finding 4), not a `solar-pro4`-specific
defect.
