# Waits until Upstage's rate-limit budget for the given model is fully
# reset (via wait-for-upstage-full-reset.sh, 10-minute cap), then runs
# the given case's own scripts/verify.sh with that model. Every case
# gets a full budget at its own start, regardless of what earlier cases
# in the same sequential run already consumed — a lighter "wait only if
# headroom looks thin" threshold check wasn't enough on its own: Case 05
# still starved partway through because it started with partial leftover
# headroom from Cases 01-04 that looked "enough" by that threshold but
# wasn't. Shared by
# verify-all-sequential.yml (CI) and available for local ad-hoc runs —
# same script, same behavior either way. Not case-specific, so it lives
# here at the repo root like wait-for-upstage-full-reset.sh, not inside
# any single case's own scripts/ directory.
#
# Usage: verify-case.sh <case-dir> <model>
#   e.g. verify-case.sh 01-solar-open2-harness solar-open2
#
# Requires: UPSTAGE_API_KEY set, plus whatever <case-dir>/scripts/verify.sh
# itself requires (see that case's own header comment) already on PATH.
