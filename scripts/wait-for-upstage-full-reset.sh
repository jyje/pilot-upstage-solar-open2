# Waits until Upstage's rate-limit window for $1 is fully reset (not
# just "some headroom") before letting the caller proceed. Used two
# ways: once at the start of each case (verify-case.sh), so every case
# starts with a full budget regardless of what earlier cases in the same
# sequential run already used; and before every retry attempt inside
# Case 05's own scripts/verify.sh, since a single question there
# (openwiki's multi-round-trip tool-calling loop) can burn most of the
# budget by itself. A lighter "wait only if headroom looks thin"
# threshold check was tried first and wasn't enough in either case: a
# case could start with partial leftover headroom that looked "enough"
# by that threshold but wasn't (run 29841216939), and retries kept
# reporting 0 tokens remaining even after waiting past the reported
# reset instant, since Upstage's limit is a rolling per-minute window,
# not a hard reset clock (run 29869480343).
#
# Hard 10-minute cap: if the window hasn't shown as fully reset by then,
# fail loudly rather than hang the whole sequential run indefinitely.

# Usage: wait-for-upstage-full-reset.sh <model>
