# Probes Upstage's rate-limit response headers for $1 (the model the
# *next* CI step is about to use) and, if headroom is actually low or
# already exceeded, sleeps until the reported reset time **plus a flat
# 30s on top** — not just a couple of seconds of margin. A tighter
# +12s buffer was tried first and still 429'd immediately after landing
# on the calculated reset instant (window refill isn't perfectly
# instantaneous, plus real network/API latency), so even once the
# window has technically reset, wait the extra 30s anyway before
# checking again. Used between steps in verify-all-sequential.yml; not
# part of any case's own scripts/verify.sh, since it isn't
# case-specific.
#
# Every Upstage API response (success or 429) carries these headers —
# there's no separate "check quota" endpoint. See:
# https://console.upstage.ai/ko/docs/guides/rate-limits
