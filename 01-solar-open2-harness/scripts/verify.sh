# Verifies that Claude Code can be driven against Upstage's Solar Open2
# model, and that its skill system works through that backend:
#   A. the `claude-upstage` convenience wrapper (piped stdin, since it
#      doesn't pass an interactive `-p`-style flag through to `claude`)
#   B. the official `claude` CLI directly, with ANTHROPIC_* env vars
#      pointed at Upstage's Anthropic-compatible endpoint
#   C. explicit invocation of the ported `git-commit-helper` skill,
#      checked against its gitmoji + type(domain) format contract
#   D. a subagent (Task tool) call, to confirm CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
#      keeps subagent traffic on solar-open2 too
#
# Requires: `claude` and `claude-upstage` on PATH, UPSTAGE_API_KEY set.
