# Verifies that Claude Code can be driven against Upstage's Solar Open 2
# model, and that its skill system works through that backend:
#   A. the `claude-upstage` convenience wrapper (piped stdin, since it
#      doesn't pass an interactive `-p`-style flag through to `claude`)
#   B. the official `claude` CLI directly, with ANTHROPIC_* env vars
#      pointed at Upstage's Anthropic-compatible endpoint
#   C. explicit invocation of the ported `git-commit-helper` skill,
#      checked against its gitmoji + type(domain) format contract
#   D. a subagent (Task tool) call, to confirm CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL
#      keeps subagent traffic on the same model too
#
# Each method prints a one-line, <=100-char preview of its real response
# (noise like the "connectors are disabled" warning stripped, newlines
# collapsed) so the CI log itself carries visible, inspectable evidence
# instead of just a pass/fail line. Every method retries up to 5 times
# with a flat 30s backoff, since this repo's cases share one Upstage
# account/rate limit — a call can 429 simply because another case just
# ran.
#
# Model under test: $SOLAR_MODEL, defaulting to solar-open2. Note: Method
# A goes through the `claude-upstage` wrapper (installed by Upstage's own
# installer, not something this repo controls) — if it doesn't honor
# $SOLAR_MODEL the way the plain `claude` CLI does in Methods B-D, it will
# keep answering as whatever model that wrapper defaults to; this script
# doesn't assert Method A's model, only that it responds.
#
# Requires: `claude` and `claude-upstage` on PATH, UPSTAGE_API_KEY set.

# (as CI does).
