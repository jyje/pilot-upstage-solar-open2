**Status:** Verified — the official Hermes Agent image completed a live
round trip to `solar-open2` through its built-in Upstage provider.

## Goal

Run [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) directly
against Upstage's **Solar Open 2** model with the official Docker image and no
protocol-converting proxy.

## Official-support finding

**The Hermes integration is official.** Hermes Agent v0.18.2 ships an
`upstage` provider in its official Docker image (`solar` is an alias). Its
bundled provider implementation explicitly handles the `solar-open*` model
family and routes it through Upstage's OpenAI-compatible API. No local plugin,
custom endpoint, LiteLLM proxy, or source patch is needed.

The complete model configuration is therefore:

```yaml
model:
  provider: upstage
  default: solar-open2
```

Authentication stays outside the YAML file in `UPSTAGE_API_KEY`. This keeps
the case on the provider path maintained and distributed by Hermes itself.

### Is `solar-open2` itself officially available?

There is an important distinction between **Hermes provider support** and
**Upstage model availability**:

- Hermes officially supports the Upstage provider and explicitly recognizes
  the Solar Open model family.
- Upstage's current public console examples use `solar-pro3`; they do not
  currently advertise `solar-open2` as the default public model.

So this case doesn't claim that every new Upstage account can select
`solar-open2`. The authenticated round trip below is the real authority
for whether the model stays enabled on the account this repo uses.
The other four cases in this repo already verified that account against
`solar-open2`; this case confirmed it again on 2026-07-20.

## Run

Export an Upstage development key, then run the verification script:

```bash
export UPSTAGE_API_KEY="..."
./scripts/verify.sh
```

The script uses the official Hermes Agent image pinned by digest, mounts an
ephemeral `/opt/data` directory containing [`config.yaml`](config.yaml), and
runs three checks:

1. the image reports a Hermes Agent version;
2. `hermes doctor` accepts the Upstage configuration; and
3. non-interactive `hermes chat` returns `hermes-ready` from `solar-open2`.

The agent's terminal backend is `local`, which means tool commands execute
inside the already isolated Hermes container. The host repository is not
mounted into the container during this verification.

## Manual invocation

The live request exercised by the script is equivalent to:

```bash
hermes chat \
  --provider upstage \
  --model solar-open2 \
  --query "Reply with exactly: hermes-ready" \
  --max-turns 2 \
  --quiet \
  --ignore-rules
```

The matching GitHub Actions workflow reuses the repository's existing
`UPSTAGE_API_KEY` secret.

## Verification result

Verified locally on 2026-07-20 with:

- Hermes Agent v0.18.2 (`2026.7.7.2`, upstream `59fdd41f`);
- the official `nousresearch/hermes-agent` image pinned by digest;
- Hermes's bundled `upstage` provider; and
- Upstage model ID `solar-open2`.

`hermes doctor` reported `Upstage Solar` connectivity as healthy, and the
non-interactive chat returned the expected live response:

```text
hermes-ready
```
