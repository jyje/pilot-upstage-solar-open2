# Runs src/demo.py end-to-end against Upstage's Solar Open 2 model via the
# Claude Agent SDK (claude-agent-sdk), and fails loudly if any of its
# three methods don't check out:
#   A. query()          - one-shot call, structured message types
#   B. ClaudeSDKClient   - multi-turn session, context retained across turns
#   C. query() + tool use - a ToolUseBlock surfaces in the structured stream
#
# Requires: `uv` and `claude` (npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code) on PATH,
# UPSTAGE_API_KEY set. Model under test: $SOLAR_MODEL, defaulting to
# solar-open2 (read by demo.py). Retries the full A/B/C run up to 5 times
# with a flat 30s backoff — this repo's cases share one Upstage
# account/rate limit, so a run can 429 simply because another case just
# ran.
