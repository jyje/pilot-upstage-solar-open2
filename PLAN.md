# Plan: pilot-upstage-solar-open2 — agent-harness experiments

## Context

This repo exists to give several independent experiments a shared,
seminar-ready home:

1. Building a Claude Code harness (skills, etc.) on top of Upstage's
   **Solar Open 2** model.
2. Running **Solar Open 2 x Hermes Agent** through Hermes's officially
   bundled Upstage provider.
3. Driving a **local Claude Code** instance programmatically with the
   **Claude Agent SDK**.
4. Initializing **deepagents** at the code level using the
   **LangChain Upstage SDK**.
5. Documenting this repo itself with **LangChain OpenWiki**, powered by
   Solar Open 2.
6. Running xAI's **Grok Build** CLI against Solar Open 2 as a custom
   model provider.
7. Deploying Hermes Agent onto Kubernetes via the community
   **`hermes-agent-helm`** chart, verified on an ephemeral **kind**
   cluster.

Each case is scoped to be independently readable, runnable, and
presentable — someone should be able to open one case's folder and follow
it without needing any of the others.

## Case 01 — Solar Open 2 x Claude Code

- **Goal**: show that a Claude Code-style harness (custom skills, project
  conventions, `.claude/` config) can run against Upstage's Solar Open 2
  model instead of Anthropic's own models, and demonstrate a couple of
  simple custom skills built for it.
- **Approach**: point Claude Code's model routing at Solar Open 2 (directly
  via Upstage's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or via a proxy such as LiteLLM —
  see `jyje/cluster`'s `clusters/r4spi/apps/litellm.yaml` for a prior
  `upstage/solar-open2` routing config to reference), then build 1-2 small
  skills to exercise it end to end.
- **Prior art to reference (not copy verbatim)**: the LiteLLM routing config
  above; this repo's own `.claude/skills/` for skill authoring conventions.
- **Expected output**: a working `.claude/skills/` setup in
  `01-solar-open2-harness/`, plus a README documenting the setup and a
  short demo transcript/recording.
- **Result**: done. Verified two ways — the official `claude-upstage`
  wrapper (piped stdin, since it doesn't forward a `-p`-style flag to
  `claude`) and the plain `claude` CLI pointed at Upstage's
  Anthropic-compatible endpoint via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`/`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`.
  Both confirmed locally and wired into CI
  (`.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml`). See
  `01-solar-open2-harness/README.md` for transcripts and the finding about
  `claude-upstage`'s argument passthrough.

## Case 02 — Solar Open 2 x Hermes Agent

- **Goal**: run NousResearch's Hermes Agent against Upstage's Solar Open 2
  model with no bridge or proxy in the request path.
- **Finding**: the current Hermes Agent release includes `upstage` as a
  built-in provider (`solar` is an alias), and its bundled implementation
  explicitly handles the `solar-open*` family. The originally considered
  named custom-provider configuration is therefore unnecessary.
  This is distinct from Upstage's public model catalog: its current
  console example uses `solar-pro3`, so `solar-open2` availability must
  still be confirmed against the repository's account by the live check.
- **Approach**: set `model.provider: upstage` and `model.default:
  solar-open2` in `config.yaml`, pass `UPSTAGE_API_KEY` only through the
  environment, and run the digest-pinned official
  `nousresearch/hermes-agent` image directly. Verify the configuration with
  `hermes doctor`, then make a non-interactive `hermes chat -m solar-open2
  --provider upstage -q "<prompt>" --max-turns 2` round trip.
- **Prior art**: `jyje/hermes-agent-helm` established the official image and
  non-interactive `hermes chat` verification pattern on Kubernetes. This
  case uses the same image directly through Docker and replaces the chart's
  proxy-oriented example with Hermes's newer bundled Upstage provider.
- **Output**: a self-contained `02-hermes-agent-solar-open2/` case with a
  `config.yaml`, verification script, English/Korean README pair, and
  matching GitHub Actions workflow.
- **Status**: verified locally on 2026-07-20 with Hermes Agent v0.18.2.
  `hermes doctor` confirmed Upstage connectivity and a non-interactive
  `solar-open2` chat returned the expected `hermes-ready` response.

## Case 03 — Solar Open 2 x Claude Agent SDK

- **Goal**: run Claude Code locally driven entirely through the Claude
  Agent SDK, not the interactive CLI — i.e. a program that opens sessions,
  sends turns, and reads results programmatically.
- **Approach**: scaffold a small uv-managed Python (or Node/TS) project
  that uses the Claude Agent SDK to launch and drive a local Claude Code
  session against a sample task, capturing input/output for the writeup.
- **Expected output**: a runnable script/CLI in
  `03-claude-agent-sdk-local/src/`, plus a README with setup + a captured
  example run.
- **Result**: done. `claude-agent-sdk` (Python) drives the same `claude`
  CLI as a subprocess, so the Solar Open 2 env var recipe from Case 01
  carries over unchanged — passed via `ClaudeAgentOptions(env={...})`
  instead of shell `export`.
  Same auth-variable finding surfaced from the SDK side: its own docs
  example (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) hangs against Upstage, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
  is required.
  Three methods verified: `query()` structured message types,
  `ClaudeSDKClient` multi-turn session memory (a number recalled across
  turns), and `ToolUseBlock` visibility for a tool call.
  Verified locally and in CI
  (`.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml`), reusing the
  `UPSTAGE_API_KEY` secret from Case 01. See
  `03-claude-agent-sdk-local/README.md` for details.

## Case 04 — Solar Open 2 x LangChain Deepagents

- **Goal**: initialize a `deepagents`-based agent at the code level with
  `langchain-upstage` supplying the model, showing how deepagents composes
  with a non-Anthropic, non-OpenAI backend.
- **Approach**: start from the `create_deep_agent()` pattern already used in
  `jyje/pilot-deep-agents` and the middleware composition style in
  `jyje/pilot-deepagents-rubrics`, swapping the model for
  `langchain-upstage`.
- **Prior art to reference (not copy verbatim)**: `jyje/pilot-deep-agents`
  (`create_deep_agent()` + simple tool demo), `jyje/pilot-deepagents-rubrics`
  (`RubricMiddleware` composition).
- **Expected output**: a runnable agent in
  `04-langchain-upstage-deepagents/src/`, plus a README with setup + a
  captured example run.
- **Result**: done. `ChatUpstage` (from `langchain-upstage`) supplies
  Solar Open 2 to `create_deep_agent()` — no `claude` CLI, no
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`/`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` dance, just `UPSTAGE_API_KEY`
  read automatically via Upstage's OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
  Finding: Python 3.14 doesn't work here yet. `tokenizers`, a
  `langchain-upstage` dependency, has no `cp314` wheel as of any release
  through `0.23.1`, and building it from source fails in this
  environment. Case 04 pins Python 3.13 instead — Case 03 (the repo's
  other `uv`-managed Python case) was moved onto 3.13 too, to unify
  every Python case on one version rather than wait on upstream.
  Three methods verified: tool use (weather lookup), deepagents' built-in
  virtual filesystem (write + read back a file), and subagent delegation
  (a named `math-agent` subagent computing `17 + 25`).
  Verified locally and in CI
  (`.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml`,
  reusing the `UPSTAGE_API_KEY` secret, no Node/`claude`-CLI step
  needed). See `04-langchain-upstage-deepagents/README.md` for details.

## Case 05 — Solar Open 2 x LangChain OpenWiki

- **Goal**: use `openwiki` (github.com/langchain-ai/openwiki) — a CLI
  that builds/maintains an agent-readable wiki for a codebase —
  configured to run on Solar Open 2, targeting `pilot-upstage-solar-open2` itself:
  document its latest commit and answer questions about it.
- **Approach**: shallow-clone this repo into a gitignored `scratch/`
  directory inside `05-langchain-openwiki-solar-open2/` and run
  `openwiki` there, so the real root `AGENTS.md` is never touched and no
  auto-PR bot goes live on this repo.
- **Result**: done, with three real findings along the way:
  1. `openwiki`'s `anthropic` provider can't reach Solar Open 2 — its
     `ChatAnthropic` construction only supports `apiKey`
     (`x-api-key`), never `authToken` (`Authorization: Bearer`).
     Confirmed via a direct 401 from Upstage. Worked around with the
     generic `openai-compatible` provider instead.
  2. Solar Open 2 drops the `tool_call` function name specifically in
     **streamed** responses (confirmed via a local logging proxy and a
     minimal `stream: false` vs `stream: true` comparison) — a real
     Upstage-side bug, not an `openwiki`/`deepagents` bug. Patched a
     fork (`jyje/openwiki`, branch
     `fix/disable-streaming-for-tool-calling-providers`) with an opt-in
     `OPENWIKI_DISABLE_STREAMING` env var; verified the fix directly.
  3. Full documentation generation (`openwiki code --update`) exceeds
     Upstage's default 50k-tokens/minute rate limit within a single
     run — a capacity/tier constraint, not a bug. The 3-question Q&A
     (cheap, single-turn) is the hard, reliably-passing verification
     gate; doc generation is attempted best-effort.
  4. `solar-pro3` needs more than a Tier-0 account's 50k-tokens/minute
     budget to answer even one question here. Its agentic tool-calling
     loop makes 4-5 sequential round trips per question, and each one
     resends the cached system prompt + all 16 tool schemas
     (~13-15k tokens/call) — cumulative usage across just 4 calls
     already exceeds 50k.
     Confirmed with a local logging proxy showing real per-call `usage`,
     alongside a `reasoning_effort=low` patch to the fork (branch
     `feat/reasoning-effort-passthrough`, committed but not yet
     pushed/merged) that ruled out reasoning overhead as the cause —
     `reasoning_tokens: 0` on every call, same result.
     Not a code bug: `solar-open2` needs fewer round trips for the same
     question and comfortably fits the same budget. Expected to work on
     Upstage's Tier 1 and above (higher RPM/TPM); just not verifiable on
     this repo's Tier-0 account.
  Verified locally and in CI
  (`.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml`,
  building the patched fork from source, reusing the `UPSTAGE_API_KEY`
  secret). See `05-langchain-openwiki-solar-open2/README.md` for
  details.

## Case 06 — Solar Open 2 x Grok Build

- **Goal**: run xAI's Grok Build CLI (launched May 2026) against Solar
  Open 2 using Grok Build's own documented "any custom model" mechanism,
  not a protocol bridge.
- **Approach**: register `solar-open2` as a `[model.X]` entry in a
  generated `config.toml`, with `api_backend = "chat_completions"` so
  Grok Build speaks Upstage's actual OpenAI-compatible wire format
  instead of the Responses API protocol Codex is locked to.
- **Result**: done, with two real findings along the way.
  1. Custom models only load from a *user-level* `config.toml` — a
     project-local `.grok/config.toml` is silently ignored for models
     (Grok Build's own docs confirm project configs are limited to MCP
     servers, plugins, and permission rules). Worked around by pointing
     `$GROK_HOME` at a throwaway temp directory for the run, same
     isolation pattern as Case 02's Hermes home and Case 03's
     `CODEX_HOME`.
  2. Built-in tool-calling fails every time with `400 Invalid function
     name: ''` — the identical signature to Case 05's Finding 2 (Upstage
     drops the tool_call function name in streamed responses). Case 05
     could patch around it because `openwiki` is open source; Grok
     Build is a closed-source binary with no equivalent flag, so this
     stays an unresolved blocker here.
  Three non-tool-use methods verified: a deterministic single-turn
  reply, a reasoning-heavy prompt checked for the correct numeric
  answer, and a small coding task (a `Python is_prime(n)` function)
  checked for correct, working code.
  Verified locally and in CI
  (`.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml`, installing `grok` via
  its official installer, reusing the `UPSTAGE_API_KEY` secret). See
  `06-grok-build-solar-open2/README.md` for details.

## Case 07 — Solar Open 2 x Hermes Agent Helm

- **Goal**: check whether the same `upstage` provider path Case 02
  verified against the plain Docker image still works once Hermes Agent
  is deployed the way an operator would actually run it long-term — as a
  Kubernetes workload, installed from the community
  [`jyje/hermes-agent-helm`](https://github.com/jyje/hermes-agent-helm)
  Helm chart.
- **Approach**: install the chart's published OCI artifact
  (`oci://ghcr.io/jyje/hermes-agent-helm/hermes-agent`, pinned to
  `v0.12.0`) onto a throwaway `kind` cluster that `scripts/verify.sh`
  creates and deletes itself, using a values file that mirrors the
  chart's own `values-upstage.yaml` example with the model swapped to
  `solar-open2`.
- **Result**: done, no new findings — this case confirms the deployment
  layer itself, not a new Solar Open 2 behavior. Three methods verified:
  the chart's own declarative `tests.chat` Helm-test Job (polled directly
  rather than trusting `helm test`'s own wait, which can stall on a CI
  runner), a live `kubectl exec` reasoning round trip against the
  running gateway pod checked for the correct numeric answer, and a
  self-reflection prompt asking Hermes (running on Solar Open 2) to
  describe its own strengths as an agent — gated loosely (10+ non-empty
  lines) since the point is capturing a real, substantive answer rather
  than an exact string. Messenger connectivity (Telegram/Discord) is
  explicitly out of scope for this case's verification — see
  `07-hermes-agent-helm-solar-open2/README.md` for how to add one via
  BotFather without changing what this case gates on. Verified locally
  and in CI
  (`.github/workflows/verify-all-sequential.yml`, installing
  `kind`/`kubectl`/`helm`, reusing the `UPSTAGE_API_KEY` secret). See
  `07-hermes-agent-helm-solar-open2/README.md` for details.

## Repo structure

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the directory tree and repo conventions
(English-only source/comments, README language policy, required
`python-lint` workflow for Python changes, `git-commit-helper` commit
policy).

## Next steps

Cases 01-07 are implemented and verified (Case 06's tool-calling has a
known, documented limitation — see its two findings above). Open items:
- Find or wait for a client-side way to disable streaming (or otherwise
  route around the dropped tool_call name) for Grok Build's custom
  providers, to unblock Case 06's tool-calling method — no such flag
  exists today, unlike the openwiki fork's fix for Case 05.
- Revisit Case 04's Python 3.13 pin once `tokenizers` ships a `cp314`
  wheel — Case 03 was moved down to 3.13 to unify both Python cases
  in the meantime, rather than wait on upstream.
- Decide whether to open an upstream issue/PR against
  `langchain-ai/openwiki` for Case 05's two findings (the `anthropic`
  provider auth gap and the streaming tool-name bug) — not done yet,
  a separate decision from building Case 05 itself.
- Revisit a direct OpenAI Codex integration once there's a clearer path
  between Codex's Responses-API provider interface and Upstage's Chat
  Completions endpoint; earlier exploration is archived in
  `draft/codex-upstage-solar-open2/`.
