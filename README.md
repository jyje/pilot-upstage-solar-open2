A single repo hosting several independent, seminar/portfolio-ready use
cases around building and running Claude Code-style agent harnesses on
top of Upstage's Solar Open2 model and the broader Claude/LangChain agent
tooling ecosystem. Each case lives in its own top-level directory and can
be read, run, and presented independently.

## Cases

| Case | Summary | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Case 01 — Solar Open2 harness](01-solar-open2-harness/) | Build a Claude Code harness (skills, etc.) backed by Upstage's Solar Open2 model | Verified |
| [Case 02 — Claude Agent SDK, local](02-claude-agent-sdk-local/) | Drive a local Claude Code instance programmatically with the Claude Agent SDK | Verified |
| [Case 03 — LangChain Upstage deepagents](03-langchain-upstage-deepagents/) | Initialize deepagents at the code level using the LangChain Upstage SDK | Verified |
| [Case 04 — LangChain OpenWiki](04-langchain-openwiki-solar-open2/) | Use `openwiki` to document this repo and answer questions about it, powered by Solar Open2 | Verified |

See [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the full plan and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for repo conventions.
